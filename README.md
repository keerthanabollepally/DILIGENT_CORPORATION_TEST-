# Jarvis – Simple AI Assistant

## About
This is a simple AI assistant built as a prototype.  
It can understand user questions, find relevant information, and reply in a conversational way.

This project focuses on showing the **basic working flow of an AI assistant**, not a full production system.

## What the Assistant Does
- Takes a question from the user  
- Searches stored knowledge for related information  
- Uses that information to generate a response  

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)
1. The user types a question  
2. The system finds the most relevant information from stored data  
3. The assistant replies using that information  

This approach helps the assistant give more meaningful answers.

## AI and Data
- A simple similarity-based search is used to retrieve information  
- This simulates how vector databases work  
- The AI response is generated locally to keep the solution simple
